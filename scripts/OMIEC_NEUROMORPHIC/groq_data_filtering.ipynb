      "The field of organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors (OMIECs) has gained significant attention due to their ability to transport both electrons and ions, making them promising candidates for various applications. Initially focused on inorganic materials, the exploration of mixed conduction has expanded to organic materials, especially polymers, owing to their advantages such as solution processability, flexibility, and property tunability. OMIECs, particularly in the form of polymers, possess both electronic and ionic transport functionalities. This review provides an overview of OMIECs in various aspects covering mechanisms of charge transport including electronic transport, ionic transport, and ionic-electronic coupling, as well as conducting/semiconducting conjugated polymers and their applications in organic bioelectronics, including (multi)sensors, neuromorphic devices, and electrochromic devices. OMIECs show promise in organic bioelectronics due to their compatibility with biological systems and the ability to modulate electronic conduction and ionic transport, resembling the principles of biological systems. Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) based on OMIECs offer significant potential for bioelectronic applications, responding to external stimuli through modulation of ionic transport. An in-depth review of recent research achievements in organic bioelectronic applications using OMIECs, categorized based on physical and chemical stimuli as well as neuromorphic devices and circuit applications, is presented.\n"

       "'Neuromorphic devices are likely to be the next evolution of computing, allowing to implement machine learning within hardware components. In biological neural systems, learning and signal processing are achieved by communication between neurons through time-dependent ion flux in the synapses. Integrating such ion-mediated operating principles in neuromorphic devices can deliver an energy efficient and powerful technology. Here a device known as a light-emitting electrochemical cell is revisited and modified, exploiting its ability to modulate current through ion accumulation/depletion at the electrodes and turn it into an organic synaptic diode. This two-terminal device is based on an organic mixed ionic-electronic conducting polymer that serves as active layer for conduction of lithium ions as well as charge carriers. The ionic conduction properties are modified by cryptand molecules, able to reversibly capture ions. The device can be reliably switched between states for at least 100 cycles and displays state retention for multiple minutes. The applicability for neuromorphic applications is further demonstrated by exploring frequency-dependent plasticity and paired-pulse facilitation behavior in the millisecond range. The polymeric nature, combined with the simple two-terminal architecture of the presented neuromorphic device, opens up a range of possibilities regarding the fabrication of artificial neural networks.'"
