       "\"A new method for selective separation of wood components is presented. Based on Hansen's theory of solubility, ionic liquid (IL) 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromine ([Bmin]Br) was mixed with aqueous ethanol. HBr the acid catalyst in the degradation of wood components, was found to form in situ by ion exchange between IL and organic acid. The hydrogen bonding capacity of the mixture was enhanced as the presence of IL, which led to the promotion of the solubilization of lignin and other products from carbohydrates hydrolysis. The data showed that, variations of the IL concentration caused cellulose to be separated from pine wood with a purity of more than 94%, or to be hydrolyzed and converted into saccharides together with hemicellulose. Because of the complete hydrolysis of hemicellulose, the cross-linked matrix of lignin and hemicellulose was destroyed, which led to the isolation of lignin with a high purity of about 93%.\""

      " Thin films of organic mixed ionic electronic conductors (OMIECs) constitute the functional layer in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), organic bioelectronic transducers and other ionic-electronic devices. The thin-film configuration constrains devices to be fabricated on impermeable substrates in the form of 2D microstructures with lateral electrodes to drive an electronic current through the thin film. In order to alleviate such constraints, novel OMIEC deposition methods are needed that produce alternatives to thin-film devices and that are compatible with permeable substrates and electronic transport in the vertical direction. Here OMIECs filled nanoporous membranes are introduced as functional layer in devices with mixed ionic electronic transport. Electropolymerization of ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) monomers is used to fabricate OMIEC filled nanochannels. Electronic and ionic transport through such nanochannels are investigated and modulation of electronic as well as ionic carrier density by action of a third gate electrode is demonstrated. The novel OMIEC nanochannels enable the fabrication of vertical OECTs with high transconductance and organic ionic transistors using only additive fabrication methods. A method is developed to electropolymerize PEDOT based organic mixed ionic electronic conductors into the nanochannels of tracketched membranes. Gated electronic and ionic transport through the membranes is investigated. The results demonstrate that the method gives access to high transconductance vertical OECTs fabricated without photolithography and to novel ionic transistors. image \n",

      " Mixed ionic-electronic conductors, such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) are postulated to be the next generation materials in energy storage and electronic devices. Although many studies have aimed to enhance the electronic conductivity and mechanical properties of these materials, there has been little focus on ionic conductivity. In this work, blends based on PEDOT stabilized by the polyelectrolyte poly(diallyldimethylammonium) (PolyDADMA X) are reported, where the X anion is either chloride (Cl), bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI), bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (TFSI), triflate (CF3SO3) or tosylate (Tos). Electronic conductivity values of 0.6 S cm(-1)were achieved in films of PEDOT:PolyDADMA FSI (without any post-treatment), with an ionic conductivity of 5 x 10(-6)S cm(-1)at 70 degrees C. Organic ionic plastic crystals (OIPCs) based on the cation N-ethyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium (C(2)mpyr(+)) with similar anions were added to synergistically enhance both electronic and ionic conductivities. PEDOT:PolyDADMA X / [C(2)mpyr][X] composites (80/20 wt%) resulted in higher ionic conductivity values (e.g., 2 x 10(-5)S cm(-1)at 70 degrees C for PEDOT:PolyDADMA FSI/[C(2)mpyr][FSI]) and improved electrochemical performance versus the neat PEDOT:PolyDADMA X with no OIPC. Herein, new materials are presented and discussed including new PEDOT:PolyDADMA and organic ionic plastic crystal blends highlighting their promising properties for energy storage applications. \n",

      " The conversion of electrochemical processes into mechanical deformation in organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors (OMIECs) enables artificial muscle-like actuators but is also critical for degradation processes affecting OMIEC-based devices. To provide a microscopic understanding of electroactuation, the modulated electrochemical atomic force microscopy (mEC-AFM) is introduced here as a novel in-operando characterization method for electroactive materials. The technique enables multidimensional spectroscopic investigations of local electroactuation and charge uptake giving access to the electroactuation transfer function. For poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) based microelectrodes, the spectroscopic measurements are combined with multichannel mEC-AFM imaging, providing maps of local electroactuation amplitude and phase as well as surface morphology. The results demonstrate that the amplitude and timescales of electroactuation are governed by the drift motion of hydrated ions. Accordingly, slower water diffusion processes are not limiting, and the results illustrate how OMIEC microactuators can operate at sub-millisecond timescales. In this work, the modulated electrochemical atomic force microscopy (mEC-AFM) is introduced to study microscopic electroactuation processes in organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors. By combining spectroscopic measurements with multichannel mEC-AFM imaging, it is demonstrated that electroswelling is governed by the drift motion of hydrated ions, achieving sub-millisecond operation in PEDOT:PSS microactuators. image \n",

      " The structure and packing of organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors have an especially significant effect on transport properties. In operating devices, this structure is not fixed but is responsive to changes in electrochemical potential, ion intercalation, and solvent swelling. Toward this end, the steady-state and transient structure of the model organic mixed conductor, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), is characterized using multimodal time-resolved operando techniques. Steady-state operando X-ray scattering reveals a doping-induced lamellar expansion of 1.6 angstrom followed by 0.4 angstrom relaxation at high doping levels. Time-resolved operando X-ray scattering reveals asymmetric rates of lamellar structural change during doping and dedoping that do not directly depend on potential or charging transients. Time-resolved spectroscopy establishes a link between structural transients and the complex kinetics of electronic charge carrier subpopulations, in particular the polaron-bipolaron equilibrium. These findings provide insight into the factors limiting the response time of organic mixed-conductor-based devices, and present the first real-time observation of the structural changes during doping and dedoping of a conjugated polymer system via X-ray scattering. \n",

      " Organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors (OMIECs) are organic materials capable of transporting both ionic species and electronic charges, facilitating ionic-electronic coupling and enhancing electrical conductivity. PEO-PEDOT/KOTf composite films synthesized in this study demonstrate significant electrical conductivity enhancement due to the ionic-electronic coupling. The electrical conductivity of PEO-PEDOT is 7.05 S.cm(-1), predominantly arising from the electronic transport of PEDOT polarons with a minor contribution from ionic transport in PEO. However, introducing KOTf into the PEO-PEDOT matrix at varying concentrations gradually increases electrical conductivity. At a KOTf concentration of 16 wt.%, the electrical conductivity reaches 51.06 S.cm(-1). This pronounced enhancement can be primarily due to the ionic-electronic coupling occurring at the interface between phase-separated regions within the polymer matrix. The incorporation of KOTf into PEO-PEDOT was characterized using FTIR spectroscopy. Moreover, our investigation involved X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry analysis, which unveiled a notable trend. As the KOTf concentrations increased, the degree of crystallinity in the PEO-PEDOT/KOTf composite films declined. This observation provides valuable insights into the structural changes occurring within the films as KOTf is integrated. The potential implications of this discovery span across numerous fields, opening exciting possibilities for advancing electronic and energy-related technologies. \n",

      " Recent studies are being focused on establishing a link between structural and mixed ionic-electronic transport properties based on the characterization of organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors (OMIECs) under operation conditions in organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) devices. Here, we report the simultaneous access to microstructural, chemical, and physical information using impedance spectroscopy and micro-Raman imaging techniques to address the mixed ionic-electronic transport mechanisms in PEDOT:PSS-based OMIECs working as OECT channel materials. We focused on the out-of-plane and in-plane mixed ionic-electronic transport mechanisms and complement our experimental studies with computational simulations using molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional theory (DFT) methodologies. Our studies revealed that the out-of-plane transport is based on ionic injection and diffusion mainly associated with the formation of nanopore channels in PEDOT:PSS exhibiting sulfonic groups toward the aqueous media. Thus, we also evidenced that the dedoping is not only due to the direct interaction of positive ions with PEDOT:PSS bulk region but also indirectly by the rearrangements of sulfonic groups from PSS toward the aqueous media. The in-plane transport in the OECT channel was properly described as a mixed ionic-electronic transport, with not only ionic transport of sodium (Na+) but also hydronium (H3O+) species mainly through nanopores and PEDOT:PSS bulk regions and with electronic transport mainly through the PEDOT:PSS bulk region. Although it is shown that the electronic transport monotonically declines with increasing ionic concentration, the Na+ diluted regime (1 mM) exhibits weak selectivity compared to H3O+ species, and the Na+ concentrated regime (100 mM) induces extreme porosity in PEDOT:PSS yielding to the destruction of the device. These results introduce some particular features for PEDOT:PSS-based OECT channel materials that need to be considered not only for ionic concentration and selectivity but also other related stability issues. \n",

      " Solid-state lithium-metal batteries are considered as one of the most promising candidates for next-generation energy storage devices with high energy density and enhanced safety. Great efforts have been made to design solid-state electrolytes with enhanced ionic conductivity and to protect the electrochemical interface of the lithium anode. However, the obstruction of ionic-electronic transport within the cathode remains as another key challenge that needs to be addressed for the practical application of solid-state batteries. Here, we prepared organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors (OMIECs) by in-situ co-polymerization of three organic monomers (boron-type crosslinker, ionic liquid, and sulfolene) in the network of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(4-styrenesulfonate). The as-prepared OMIECs show an electronic conductivity up to 33.6 S cm-1 and ionic conductivity of 1.7x10-4 S cm-1 at 30 degrees C, and also binder functionality, providing a combined path for Li+/e- transport in cathodes and maintaining mechanical/(electro-)chemical stability. As a result, solid-state cathodes composed of 90.0 wt % active materials and only 10.0 wt % OMIECs display exceptional electrochemical characteristics at 30 degrees C, including high C-rate capabilities and prolonged cycle life. This novel design of all-in-one OMIECs for carbon-free cathodes demonstrates a promising strategy for developing multifunctional additives for high-performance solid-state batteries. The strategy of OMIECs design endows carbon-free solid-state cathodes with optimized ratio, temporally stable interface, and fast electronic/ionic transport path.

      " Organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors (OMIECs) are being explored in applications such as bioelectronics, biosensors, energy conversion and storage, and optoelectronics. OMIECs are largely composed of conjugated polymers that couple ionic and electronic transport in their structure as well as synthetic flexibility. Despite extensive research, previous studies have mainly focused on either enhancing ion conduction or enabling synthetic modification. This limited the number of OMIECs that excel in both domains. Here, a series of OMIECs based on functionalized poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) copolymers that combine efficient ion/electron transport with the versatility of post-functionalization were developed. EDOT monomers bearing sulfonic (EDOTS) and carboxylic acid (EDOTCOOH) groups were electrochemically copolymerized in different ratios on oxygen plasma-treated conductive substrates. The plasma treatment enabled the synthesis of copolymers containing high ratios of EDOTS (up to 68%), otherwise not possible with untreated substrates. This flexibility in synthesis resulted in the fabrication of copolymers with tunable properties in terms of conductivity (2-0.0019 S/cm) and ion/electron transport, for example, as revealed by their volumetric capacitances (122-11 F/cm(3)). The importance of the organic nature of the OMIECs that are amenable to synthetic modification was also demonstrated. EDOTCOOH was successfully post-functionalized without influencing the ionic and electronic transport of the copolymers. This opens a new way to tailor the properties of the OMIECs to specific applications, especially in the field of bioelectronics. \n",

      " Organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors (OMIECs) combine electronic semiconductor functionality with ionic conductivity, biocompatibility, and electrochemical stability in water and are currently investigated as the active material in devices for bioelectronics, neuromorphic computing, as well as energy conversion and storage. Operation speed of such devices depends on fast electronic transport in OMIECs. However, due to contact resistance problems, reliable measurements of electronic mobility are difficult to achieve in this class of materials. To address the problem, the electrolyte-gated van der Pauw (EgVDP) method is introduced for the simple and accurate determination of the electrical characteristics of OMIEC thin films, independent of contact effects. The technique is applied to the most widespread OMIEC blend, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS). By comparing with organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) measurements, it is found that gate voltage dependent contact resistance effects lead to systematic errors in OECT based transport characterization. These observations confirm that a contact-independent technique is crucial for the proper characterization of OMIECs, and the EgVDP method reveals to be a simple, elegant, but effective technique for this scope. \n",

Conducting polymers such as PEDOT:PSS have been already studied as binders for high-performance lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) but without addressing the structure-property relationships of the binder in the electrode.

Here, we have synthesized a water-soluble, bio-inspired ion conductor melanin (Mel) and blended it with benchmark conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) to form a new OMIEC. We explored the potential of Mel/PEDOT:PSS OMIEC blends in two critical device applications: organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) and supercapacitors (SuperCaps). Mel incorporation into PEDOT:PSS enhances the ionic-electronic coupling when ions from an electrolyte are injected into the material, increasing the volumetric capacitance of PEDOT:PSS films ten-fold. The addition of Mel in PEDOT:PSS also increases the transconductance of OECTs (from 7 +/- 1 to 11 +/- 3 mS), and the energy and power densities of SuperCaps, from 0.41 +/- 0.02 to 0.62 +/- 0.01 W h kg-1 and from 119 +/- 14 to 190 +/- 6 W kg-1, respectively.

Our conducting hydrogels are based on crosslinked PVA with PEDOT:PSS interacting via hydrogen bonding and exhibit an excellent swelling ratio of similar to 180-200% w/w. Our electrochemical impedance studies indicate that the charge transport and transfer processes at the channel material based on conducting hydrogels are not trivial compared to conducting polymeric films. The most relevant feature is that the ionic transport through the swollen hydrogel is clearly different from the transport through the solution, and the charge transfer and diffusion processes govern the low-frequency regime. In addition, we have performed in operando Raman spectroscopy analyses in the OECT devices supported by first-principle computational simulations corroborating the doping/de-doping processes under different applied gate voltages. The maximum transconductance (g(m)similar to 1.05 mu S) and maximum volumetric capacitance (C*similar to 2.3 F.cm(-3)) values indicate that these conducting hydrogels can be promising candidates as channel materials for OECT devices. \n",

The first cycle revealed slow electrowetting and cation-proton exchange. Subsequent cycles showed rapid response with minor cation fluctuation (similar to 5%). Comparison with optical-tracked electrochromic fronts revealed mesoscale structure-dependent proton transport. The calculated effective ion mobility demonstrated thickness-dependent behavior, emphasizing an interfacial ion transport pathway with a higher mobile ion density. The decoupling of interfacial effects on bulk ion mobility and the decoupling of cation and proton migration elucidate ion transport in conventional and emerging OMIEC-based devices and has broader implications for other ionic conductors writ large. \n",

We find an asymmetry in the de- and redoping mass transport kinetics and attribute this process to subsecond ion migration and slower ion reorganization. Furthermore, the kinetic constants from the EQCM measurements are compared to those from organic electrochemical transistors and from changes in structural packing by normalizing the corresponding RC time constants across experiments. This multimodal investigation allows us to deduce a sequence of mass, charge, and structure kinetics in OMIEC materials during the de-and redoping processes. The kinetics of processes in acid-treated PEDOT/PSS in response to step voltages can be clustered into three main subprocesses, namely, fast polarization, charge carrier population kinetics and macroscale transport, and slow relaxation. These findings provide a basis for future OMIEC design by determining the factors that affect response time and short-term stability of OMIEC devices. \n",

      " The performance of next generation solid-state lithium metal batteries (LMBs) is intimately related to the ionic-electronic interconnection within the cathode material. In batteries containing liquid electrolytes, the soaking of the electrolyte and the addition of carbon provide sufficient ionic and electronic conductivity through the cathode. However, in solid-state systems, cathodes are completely dry, and thus, they lack mobile Li ions and good electronic interconnection. Organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors (OMIECs) are promising binders to provide that interconnection through a compact carbon-free cathode. However, most of the OMIECs have been developed based on solvent swelling of conducting polymers or combining with ionic liquids as composites. These options are not the most adequate ones for LMBs due to liquid-related issues such as leakage. Here, a novel approach towards all-solid-state OMIECs is presented by combining PEDOT:PSS and different organic ionic plastic crystals (OIPCs): C(2)mpyrFSI and C(2)mpyrTFSI, obtaining a synergistic effect with higher ionic and electronic conductivities than those of the neat materials (sigma(electronic) of 580 S cm(-1) and sigma(ionic) of 3.7 10(-5) S cm(-1) at 70 degrees C). These outstanding values for all-solid state OMIECs resulted from highly ordered conducting pathways as demonstrated by XRD and AFM. The optimum composition with respect to electronic and ionic conductivity (80/20 PEDOT:PSS/C(2)mpyFSI) was subsequently tested, for the first time, as a binder in a LiFePO4 cathode formulation in a carbon-free solid-state battery.

      " By employing time-dependent open-circuit voltage measurement, we demonstrate that a redundant ionic Seebeck component in the mixed ion-electron conducting polymer PEDOT:PSS can be suppressed by simple chemical treatments. The suppression of ionic Seebeck can be attributed to both increase in electronic conductivity and reduction in ionic conductivity, which results in a significant increase in the ratio of electronic-to-ionic conductivity. The thermogravimetric analysis and thickness swelling test confirm that PEDOT:PSS film becomes less or non-hygroscopic after treatment. Low hygroscopicity in the PEDOT:PSS film effectively cuts off the moisture-assisted ion conducting channel, consequently the ionic conductivity becomes extremely low and the ionic Seebeck component is suppressed even at a high humidity (90% RH) condition. The chemical treatment turns out to be a highly promising method to eliminate ionic Seebeck component in the mixed ion-electron conducting polymers and thus to generate consistent thermovoltage for the practical thermoelectric application. \n",

These properties are essential for applications in bioelectronics (sensors, actuators), charge storage devices, and electrochromic displays. Importantly, past studies on mixed ionic-electronic transport in PEDOT:PSS neglected to consider how the molecular structure of PSS affects mixed ionic-electronic transport. Herein, we therefore investigated the effect of the molecular weight and size distribution of PSS on the electronic properties and morphology of PEDOT:PSS both in dry and aqueous environments, and overall performance in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs). Using reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization with two different chain transfer agents, six PSS samples with monomodal, narrow (D = 1.1) and broad (D = 1.7) size distributions and varying molecular weights were synthesized and used as matrices for PEDOT. We found that using higher molecular weight of PSS (M-n = 145 kg mol(-1)) and broad dispersity led to OECTs with the highest transconductance (up to 16 mS) and [mu C*] values (similar to 140 F cm(-1) V-1 s(-1)) in PEDOT:PSS, despite having a lower volumetric capacitance (C* = 35 +/- 4 F cm(-3)). The differences were best explained by studying the microstructure of the films by atomic force microscopy (AFM). We found that heterogeneities in the PEDOT:PSS films (interconnected and large PEDOT- and PSS-rich domains) obtained from high molecular weight and high dispersity PSS led to higher charge mobility (mu(OECT) similar to 4 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)) and hence transconductance.

Symmetric PEDOT:PSS supercapacitors with electrode thicknesses of 4.7 mu m charge 40 times faster due to the combination of improved ionic and electronic conductivity. In these devices, PEDOT:PSS was deposited on two sides of a porous polymer separator by spray coating, and then soaked in either methanol, methanol mixed with the ionic liquid EMITFSI (50% v/v), ethylene glycol, ethylene glycol mixed with EMITFSI (50% v/v), or dimethyl sulfoxide. Ionic resistance dictates the charging time in untreated films. Treatment with methanol combined with EMITFSI results in the highest ionic conductivity (0.02 S/m), combined with an electronic conductivity of 498 S/m and the highest cut-off frequency. In addition, these treatments increase volumetric capacitance. The increases are most likely due to the removal of insulating PSS by the polar solvents, resulting in the formation of an open polymer structure in which ions can move more freely.

      " Mixed conducting polymer electrodes built from poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) are attracting a great deal of interest in healthcare monitoring. However, the widespread application of this organic conductor in wearable devices is seriously restricted by toxic additives used to enhance its electrical conductivity. Herein, we explored a family of biocompatible ionic liquids (ILs), based on the cholinium cation and different carboxylated anions, as dopants and gelators for PEDOT:PSS to formulate safe bioelectrodes for long-term cutaneous recording. We examined the effect of the IL anion on the ionic-electronic conductivities and physicochemical properties of these soft conductors. Among the different ILs tested, cholinium lactate ([Ch][Lac]) afforded the greatest increase in the materials' electronic conductivity (approximate to 30 S cm(-1)vs. 0.2 S cm(-1) for non-formulated PEDOT:PSS). Moreover, the PEDOT:PSS/IL mixtures formed gels due to supramolecular intereactions. The gels showed a rheological behavior associated to gels with excellent injectability properties. Finally, the performance of PEDOT:PSS/[Ch][Lac] as biocompatible electrodes for electrocardiogram recording is discussed. All in all, the obtained results unveil the effectiveness of cholinum-based ILs as non-toxic dopants of PEDOT:PSS, paving the way to explore novel bioderived electrolytes. \n",

      " The major challenges in developing self-healable conjugated polymers for organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) lie in maintaining good mixed electronic/ionic transport and the need for fast restoration to the original electronic and structural properties after the self-healing process. Herein, we provide the first report of an all-solid-state OECT that is self-healable and possesses good electrical performance, by utilizing a matrix of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and a nonionic surfactant, Triton X-100, as a channel and an ion-conducting poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogel as a quasi-solid-state polymer electrolyte. The fabricated OECT exhibits high transconductance (maximum 54 mS), an on/ off current ratio of similar to 1.5 x 10(3), a fast response time of 6.8 ms, and good operational stability after 68 days of storage. Simultaneously, the OECT showed remarkable self-healing and ion-sensing behaviors and recovered similar to 95% of its ion sensitivity after healing. These findings will contribute to the development of high-performance and robust OECTs for wearable bioelectronic devices. \n",

      " Organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors, such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), are essential materials for the fabrication of bioelectronic devices due to their unique ability to couple and transport ionic and electronic charges. The growing interest in bioelectronic devices has led to the development of organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) that can operate in aqueous solutions and transduce ionic signals of biological origin into measurable electronic signals. A common challenge with OECTs is maintaining the stability and performance of the PEDOT:PSS films operating under aqueous conditions. Although the conventional approach of blending the PEDOT:PSS dispersions with a cross-linker such as (3-glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane (GOPS) helps to ensure strong adhesion of the films to device substrates, it also impacts the morphology and thus electrical properties of the PEDOT:PSS films, which leads to a significant reduction in the performance of OECTs. In this study, we instead functionalize only the surface of the device substrates with GOPS to introduce a silane monolayer before spin-coating the PEDOT:PSS dispersion on the substrate. In all cases, having a GOPS monolayer instead of a blend leads to increased electronic performance metrics, such as three times higher electronic conductivity, volumetric capacitance, and mobility-capacitance product [mu C*] value in OECT devices, ultimately leading to a record value of 406 +/- 39 F cm(-1) V-1 s(-1) for amorphous PEDOT:PSS. This increased performance does not come at the expense of operational stability, as both the blend and surface functionalization show similar performance when subjected to pulsed gate bias stress, long-term electrochemical cycling tests, and aging over 150 days. Overall, this study establishes a novel approach to using GOPS as a surface monolayer instead of a blended cross-linker, for achieving high-performance organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors that are stable in water for bioelectronics. \n",

      " The thermoelectric (TE) phenomena are intensively explored by the scientific community due to the rather inefficient way energy resources are used with a large fraction of energy wasted in the form of heat. Among various materials, mixed ion-electron conductors (MIEC) are recently being explored as potential thermoelectrics, primarily due to their low thermal conductivity. The combination of electronic and ionic charge carriers in those inorganic or organic materials leads to complex evolution of the thermovoltage (V-oc) with time, temperature, and/or humidity. One of the most promising organic thermoelectric materials, poly(3,4-ethyelenedioxythiophene)-polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT-PSS), is an MIEC. A previous study reveals that at high humidity, PEDOT-PSS undergoes an ionic Seebeck effect due to mobile protons. Yet, this phenomenon is not well understood. In this work, the time dependence of the V-oc is studied and its behavior from the contribution of both charge carriers (holes and protons) is explained. The presence of a complex reorganization of the charge carriers promoting an internal electrochemical reaction within the polymer film is identified. Interestingly, it is demonstrated that the time dependence behavior of V-oc is a way to distinguish between three classes of polymeric materials: electronic conductor, ionic conductor, and mixed ionic-electronic conductor. \n",

PE2gT, PT2gTT, and PT2gT are operable in p-type accumulation mode organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), with PT2gT displaying the best device performance with a mu C* product figure-of-merit of 290 F cm-1 V-1 s-1. A record volumetric capacitance among p-type glycolated polythiophene OMIECs of 313 F cm-3 is observed for PE2gT, ascribed to the high proportionality of polar components in its materials design. The good OECT performance of PE2gT with mu C* = 84.2 F cm-1 V-1 s-1, comparable with state-of-the-art poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) devices, coupled with its synthetic accessibility and favorable accumulation mode operation makes PE2gT an ideal glycolated alternative to PEDOT:PSS in bioelectronics. PE2gT with the least negative threshold voltage also displays the best OECT operational cycling stability, linked to better resistance of its oxidized state against parasitic redox side reactions . Shelf life stability of OECTs stored (without bias) is observed to be better for materials with a more negative threshold voltage and higher average molecular weight (PT2gT), that are less susceptible to ambient auto-oxidation and film delamination. Four glycolated polythiophene polymers, PE2gTT, PE2gT, PT2gTT, and PT2gT are synthesized by atom-efficient direct arylation polymerization for application as active materials in organic electrochemical transistors. PT2gT exhibits the best device performance with a mu C* product figure-of-merit of 290 F cm-1 V-1 s-1, whilst volumetric capacitances of PE2gT, PT2gTT, and PT2gT are all among the highest reported for glycolated polythiophenes.image \n",

Such devices require polymeric materials to efficiently transport and couple ionic and electronic charges in aqueous media, therefore demanding water -insoluble systems capable of efficient electronic and ionic conductions. This has created a fundamental stability -performance compromise for water-soluble conducting polymers such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), whereby stability has been achieved at the expense of electronic properties. Here, we demonstrate a breakthrough in structural stabilization of PEDOT:PSS through electrostatic self -assembly (ESA) that leads to the formation of an efficient mixed conductor in a hydrated state. Benefiting from the multiscale morphology control provided by ESA, PEDOT:PSS mixed conductors exhibit superior carrier mobility and high volumetric capacitance resulting in a state-of-the-art thin-film OECT figure of merit (mC* = 752.5 F/cmVs) in aqueous media, making this approach suitable for creating robust mixed conductors for bioelectronic applications and beyond. \n",

We investigate the characteristics of a series of poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene) (PEDOT)-based materials with a new class of anionic polyelectrolytes used as dopants and stabilizers, replacing the traditionally used poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS). We show that the backbone of the polyanion plays a major role in determining device performance, while its molecular weight and the counter ion used during PEDOT synthesis play a less important role. We find that transconductance increases with the degree of swelling of the film, consistent with enhanced ion transport. Finally, we identify a polymer that offers performance close to the state-of-the-art. This work highlights the importance of the polyanion phase as a means to control OECT performance.

The spectral signatures of neutral, polaronic, and bipolaronic states of PEDOT are resolved using multivariate curve resolution analysis. Kinetic modeling of their dynamics reveals that both the dedoping and redoping are sequential processes and occur within a few hundred milliseconds in the system. Evaluation of the temperature-dependence with the Van't Hoff, Arrhenius, and Eyring formalisms highlights the role of entropy in both the establishment of the redox equilibrium at a given voltage bias and the reaction rates.

The novel characteristics have albeit rendered IGT a promising platform for integrated bioelectronics, its potential in high-frequency applications has yet been fully harnessed. Moreover, a study from a material's point of view is especially needed for this recently emerged platform as the necessity of maintaining the internal ion reservoir has posed difficulties in processing hydrated poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrene sulphonate) (PEDOT:PSS) with electronically favorable morphologies. Herein, a comprehensive investigation of the structural and functional properties of ion-embedded PEDOT:PSS modified by different annealing temperatures is performed and correlated to the IGT performance. A short-time high-temperature annealing treatment is found effective in facilitating the formation of compact microstructures without significantly influencing film hydration. The structural improvement enhances the film's conductivity and hole mobility, with the corresponding IGTs exhibiting higher gain, higher conductance, and high cut-off frequency consistently in a batch. This study also successfully demonstrates the first use of electrochemical transistors like IGTs in high-frequency applications through proof-of-concept experiments simulating fluid estimation in 50 kHz bioimpedance analysis.

      " Organic electrochemical transistors (OECT) are gaining momentum in future applications of biosensors and bioelectronics. Nonetheless, contact (or series) resistances (R-S/D) remain underexplored, even though physical processes between the source/drain electrodes and organic mixed ionic-electron conductors (OMIECs) drive a substantial part of their performances. To address this shortcoming, in this study, low-dimension OECTs featuring 2 mu m-long poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) and polystyrene sulfonate acid (PEDOT:PSS) channel are explored. Normalized contact resistances (R-S/D center dot W) values as low as 1.4 W cm are obtained. It is observed that channel PEDOT:PSS thickness is not detrimental to R-S/D but is impacting the cut-off frequency. A figure-of-merit (h) expressing the charge-carrier injection (or extraction, respectively) efficiency shows that planar depletion-mode OECTs are not contact-limited up to L = 30 mu m channel length. Finally, an unprecedented approach that highlight the importance of optimizing the micro-fabrication technologies is shown, by decreasing the contact overlap length, according to OMIECs physicochemical contact properties. Indeed, a transfer-length method coupled to a current-crowding model allow to fully understand the behavior of low-dimension PEDOT:PSS OECTs and next, to optimize its circuits design. This is paving the way toward the development of OECTs-based integrated circuits with faster switching speed, broadening further their scopes and future use as advanced bioelectronics platforms. \n",

      " Organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors (OMIECs) have emerged as promising materials for biological sensing, owing to their electrochemical activity, stability in an aqueous environment, and biocompatibility. Yet, OMIEC-based sensors rely predominantly on the use of composite matrices to enable stimuli-responsive functionality, which can exhibit issues with intercomponent interfacing. In this study, an approach is presented for non-enzymatic glucose detection by harnessing a newly synthesized functionalized monomer, EDOT-PBA. This monomer integrates electrically conducting and receptor moieties within a single organic component, obviating the need for complex composite preparation. By engineering the conditions for electrodeposition, two distinct polymer film architectures are developed: pristine PEDOT-PBA and molecularly imprinted PEDOT-PBA. Both architectures demonstrated proficient glucose binding and signal transduction capabilities. Notably, the molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) architecture demonstrated faster stabilization upon glucose uptake while it also enabled a lower limit of detection, lower standard deviation, and a broader linear range in the sensor output signal compared to its non-imprinted counterpart. This material design not only provides a robust and efficient platform for glucose detection but also offers a blueprint for developing selective sensors for a diverse array of target molecules, by tuning the receptor units correspondingly. A synthetically tailored electroactive monomer with binding affinity for sugars is used to fabricate 3D polymer scaffolds via electrodeposition. By controlling the polymer deposition conditions, mixed ionic-electronic conducting polymer films with built-in selectivity toward glucose are obtained without the use of enzymes or other external mediators. Proof-of-concept organic electrochemical transistor-based sensors are fabricated to evaluate the sensor performance. image \n",

Herein, a dipping-based process to prepare PEDOT:PSS films on nonplanar surfaces without crosslinker is developed. Sequential soaking of a dip-coated PEDOT:PSS film in ethanol and water imparts water resistance to the film. Microscopic and spectroscopic techniques are used to monitor the process and confirm that the ethanol soaking elutes the excess PSS from the film bulk, which stabilizes the film prior to the water-soaking process. The obtained films act as conductors and semiconductors on curved surfaces, including 3D-printed objects. A film deposited on a curved surface is successfully applied as the channel layer in a neuromorphic organic electrochemical transistor.

      " Neuromorphic systems that display synaptic conditioning based on biochemical signaling activity have recently been introduced in the form of artificial synapses that are model devices to develop tissue-interfaced platforms. In this regard, biohybrid synapses promise adaptive neuron-integrated functions. However, these systems suffer from both molecular cross-talk as biological neural circuits signal transmission typically involves more than one neuromodulator, and unstable electronics wirings as complex architectures are required to interface the tissues. Moreover, whilst novel spiking circuits can work as artificial neurons, they only recreate the biological electrical signaling pathway while electrochemical signal transduction is required for inter-neuron communication. As such, artificial chemically-mediated synapses are essential to perform memory/learning computing functions. Herein, an electrochemical neuromorphic organic device (ENODe) working as an artificial synapse that overcomes electrochemical and readout interferences while it emulates two neurotransmitters synaptic weight modulation and their recycling machinery at the synaptic cleft is shown. Neuronal short- and long-term plasticity are replicated by transducing two separate neurotransmitter-mediated chemical signals into reversible and nonreversible variations of PEDOT:PSS conductance. By exploiting the electrochromic properties of PEDOT:PSS, an alternative optical monitoring strategy is introduced which promises stable multidevice readout from complex bio-hybrid interfaces. The platform emulates high-order biological processes such as intrinsic forgetting, memory consolidation, and neurotransmitter co-modulation. These brain-inspired functionalities herald the development of tissue-integrated neuromorphic systems that combine spiking (electrical neurons) and nonspiking (electrochemical synapses) elements, thus envisioning prosthetic bridges for neural engineering and regenerative medicine. \n",

A low operation voltage without sacrificing device performance is desired to realize long-term monitoring of biological activities. In the present work, oxoammonium salts with two different counterions (TEMPO+X-, where TEMPO = 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxoammonium; X = Br- and TFSI-) are employed as secondary dopants to modulate the device perform-ance. Both oxoammonium salts feature a distinct dopant concentration-dependent doping effect, allowing precise control in improving the performance of OECTs. A zero-gate bias, corresponding to the maximum transconductance, and a low threshold voltage are realized by optimizing the dopant concentrations. In addition, TEMPO+TFSI- dopant exerts great capability in modulating the work function and in morphology reconstruction of PEDOT:PSS, ensuring a well-matched work function at the gold electrode-channel material interface and condensed microstructure stacking with an edge-on orientation in the doped PEDOT:PSS films. The synergistic effect of TEMPO and the TFSI- counterion endows the device with superior performance to its counterparts due to the resultant higher mu C* figure, benefiting from the efficient injection/extraction of holes at the interface and enhanced intra -and inter-chain carrier transport.

In this study, we optimize non-ionic surfactants mixed in a PEDOT:PSS solution to upgrade a low-grade product of low conductivity to the level of a high-grade product of high conductivity. This study systematically investigates the phase diagram, morphology, conductivity, and mechanical stability of the PEDOT:PSS films according to the hydrophilicity of non-ionic surfactants. This study reveals that the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS film varies greatly depending on the chemical structure of the surfactant and its weight fraction in the thin film. Under the optimum conditions (chemical structure and weight fraction) of the surfactant, the conductivity of the low value product could be improved to the conductivity level of the high value product. The electrical properties of the films were excellently stable even under the extreme cyclic bending tests at a bending radius of 1.5 mm. The low-grade and high grade products showed the same electrical performance when they were used in the Ag nanowires/PEDOT: PSS hybrid transparent electrodes.

Operando NMR spectroscopy is now used to quantify cation and water movement during doping/dedoping in mixed conductor films. Although organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors are widely proposed for use in bioelectronics, energy generation/storage and neuromorphic computing, our fundamental understanding of the charge-compensating interactions between the ionic and electronic carriers and the dynamics of ions remains poor, particularly for hydrated devices and on electrochemical cycling. Here we show that operando Na-23 and H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can quantify cation and water movement during the doping/dedoping of films comprising the widely used mixed conductor poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). A distinct Na-23 quadrupolar splitting is observed due to the partial ordering of the PSS chains within the PEDOT:PSS-rich domains, with respect to the substrate. Operando Na-23 NMR studies reveal a close-to-linear correlation between the quadrupolar splitting and the charge stored, which is quantitatively explained by a model in which the holes on the PEDOT backbone are bound to the PSS SO3- groups; an increase in hole concentration during doping inversely correlates with the number of Na+ ions bound to the PSS chains within the PEDOT-rich ordered domains, leading to a decrease in ions within the ordered regions and a decrease in quadrupolar splitting. The Na+-to-electron coupling efficiency, measured via Na-23 NMR intensity changes, is close to 100% when using a 1 M NaCl electrolyte. Operando H-1 NMR spectroscopy confirms that the Na+ ions injected into/extracted from the wet films are hydrated. These findings shed light on the working principles of organic mixed conductors and demonstrate the utility of operando NMR spectroscopy in revealing structure-property relationships in electroactive polymers. \n",

As an electrode, the gel exhibits a specific current response to glucose within the standard concentration range measured in the complex blood-like medium. When integrated as the lateral, micrometer-scale gate electrode of an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT), the channel current is proven to be sensitive to the presence of glucose in the measurement solution. The advantage of the OECT-based sensor compared to the amperometric electrode is its miniaturized form, amplified input signal as well the elimination of a reference electrode. Adaptable to different geometries, this conducting gel exhibits multifunctionality within its soft, gel-like architecture, that is, mixed ionic and electronic conductivity and glucose-specific electrical response. \n",

      " A wearable and transparent thermoelectric (TE) hydrogel based on bisulfate transport was demonstrated to record a negative ionic Seebeck coefficient of -25.0 mV K-1, ionic power factor of 9.94 mW m(-1) K-2, and an ionic figure of merit of 7.2 at 80% relative humidity and room temperature. The n-type TE hydrogel was made of electronic poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), ionic poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid), and biocompatible bisulfate, which was used as a thermally diffusive anion carrier for the first time in TE devices, to realize a soft mixed ionic-electronic conductor. The composition of this hydrogel was precisely controlled by varying the contents of ammonium persulfate and 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene to afford a transparent and self-healable film that recovered within 15 min after cutting (cut width of similar to 35 mu m). Bisulfate transport was visualized using an anion detective fluorophore as a tool to intuitively elucidate the Soret effect, in which ion carriers thermodiffuse from hot to cold parts, and to quantify the thermovoltage simultaneously. A flexible band-type TE energy harvester with 20 legs was fabricated to afford a thermovoltage of -2.75 V at a temperature gradient of 5.5 K, and the harvested energy was used to operate a light-emitting diode for the first time in an organic TE module with a small temperature gradient (<10 K). Moreover, a colorful wearable band-type module and photothermal all organic TE device were demonstrated to be effective self-powered body-worn TE harvesters under ambient conditions. \n",

      " Conducting polymers, which can simultaneously support transport of ions in addition to electronic charges, form the basis for electrochemical devices that transduce ionic signals into electronic signals, and vice versa. Understanding and controlling mixed conduction is, however, challenging due to a lack of methodology to simultaneously probe ion (and hole) injection and/or transport, as well as the morphology and film microstructure through which ions traverse. Here, we present a straightforward technique that takes advantage of the electrochromic nature of conducting polymers in order to deduce links between conjugated polymer aggregates, molecular (dis) order, and ion penetration. The morphology of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) films and, subsequently, ionic transport are tuned by the addition of the co-solvent ethylene glycol in the dispersions. Time lapse UV-VIS spectra of these films, acquired during their redox-cycle, provide valuable insight into the pathways of ions inside the conducting polymer and the nature of aggregates therein. The structure-property relationships gained using such techniques promise to guide the design of polymeric active materials for devices that rely on mixed conduction. \n",

      " Next-generation neural interfaces for bidirectional communication with the central nervous system aim to achieve the intimate integration with the neural tissue with minimal neuroinflammatory response, high spatio-temporal resolution, very high sensitivity, and readout stability. The design and manufacturing of devices for low power/low noise neural recording and safe and energy-efficient stimulation that are, at the same time, conformable to the brain, with matched mechanical properties and biocompatibility, is a convergence area of research where neuroscientists, materials scientists, and nanotechnologists operate synergically. The biotic-abiotic neural interface, however, remains a formidable challenge that prompts for new materials platforms and innovation in device layouts. Conductive polymers (CP) are attractive materials to be interfaced with the neural tissue and to be used as sensing/stimulating electrodes because of their mixed ionic-electronic conductivity, their low contact impedance, high charge storage capacitance, chemical versatility, and biocompatibility. This manuscript reviews the state-of-the-art of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-based neural interfaces for extracellular recording and stimulation, focusing on those technological approaches that are successfully demonstrated in vivo. The aim is to highlight the most reliable and ready-for-clinical-use solutions, in terms of materials technology and recording performance, other than spot major limitations and identify future trends in this field. \n",

      " Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) was deposited on ITO surface by cyclic voltammetry from mixed toluene/acetonitrile solvent. Thickness and oxidation state of the layer were monitored by UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy and grazing angle FTIR (GA-FTIR) spectroscopy. Morphology had fibrillar character with roughness and porosity dependent on the thickness of the layer. PEDOT was incorporated into organic photovoltaic cell as a hole extraction layer with spin-coated P3HT-PCBM intrinsic layer without further annealing. Performance of the cell was found to be effected by the morphology of the PEDOT layer. A fully doped PEDOT layer of moderate thickness was found to have the highest efficiency demonstrating an open-circuit voltage (V-oc) of 0.48 V, short-circuit current (I-sc) of 5.1 mA/cm(2), fill factor (FF) of 0.46, and overall efficiency (epsilon) of 1.1%. Electrochemically deposited PEDOT was compared to traditional spin-coated PEDOT-PSS of the same thickness. Although V-oc and I-sc were the same, a 30% improvement in the fill factor was observed for electrochemically deposited PEDOT. The phenomenon was attributed to lower series resistance of the cell due to higher hole mobility of pure PEDOT and better electrical contacts with both the ITO electrode and intrinsic layers. \n",

      " Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is one of the most widely studied conductive polymers, owing to its excellent electrical, optical, and mechanical properties, with various applications such as organic electrochemical transistors, electrochromics, and flexible/stretchable supercapacitors. The charging mechanism of PEDOT:PSS supercapacitors has been traditionally believed to be faradaic, which involves the transfer of charge across the electrode/electrolyte interface. In the present work, however, robust experimental evidence suggests that the PEDOT:PSS supercapacitors mainly store and deliver charge nonfaradaically. The various electrochemical properties of PEDOT:PSS electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) are clearly distinguishable from those of polyaniline (PANI) pseudocapacitors, which store charge faradaically. Owing to the nonfaradaic mechanism, the frequency response of PEDOT:PSS supercapacitors is comparable to that of state-of-the-art ultrafast EDLCs with carbon-based electrodes, making them suitable for high-frequency applications such as 60 Hz AC line filtering. This result is of great importance for the fundamental understanding of the charging mechanism of mixed ionic-electronic conducting polymers, such as PEDOT:PSS, and is expected to contribute to the development of various electrochemical devices based on this type of material. \n",

      " The ongoing electrification of many energy systems has created a large demand for low-cost and scalable electrical energy storage solutions. Conducting polymer supercapacitors have received significant attention for this purpose due to the abundance of their constituent materials. Although there exists a large body of experimental work on conducting polymer supercapacitors, a detailed understanding of the mixed electronic-ionic transport processes within these devices and the included materials, is still lacking. Modelling, in combination with experimental data, is a powerful tool to facilitate a detailed understanding of the transport processes within the materials and devices. However, to date, there has been a shortage of physical models which account for the non-ideal capacitances typically found in conducting polymer-based supercapacitors. Here, we report a novel model which reproduces experimental data and provides insights into the cyclic voltammograms, galvanostatic charge-discharge curves, self-discharge characteristics, and impedance spectroscopy results of supercapacitors based on the conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and cellulose nanofibrils. We find that the non-ideal capacitive characteristics of the supercapacitors can be reproduced by the incorporation of heterogeneous ion transport features within the electrodes, comprising low ion diffusivity regions. The difference in charging rates of the high and low ion diffusivity regions accounts for the experimentally observed trends in cyclic voltammograms and self-discharge characteristics. The developed model demonstrates how complex transport processes, which govern the specifications of organic energy devices, can be analysed beyond the scope of conventional equivalent circuit models. It also provides an insight into how various transport and polarization processes are manifested in real measurement data and thus defines the limiting processes of conducting polymer energy storage devices. \n",

      " Sensing bioelectrical signals is of great significance to understand human disease. Reliable bioelectronic interface is the guarantee of high-quality bioelectrical signals. The unique electrochemical property and the mixed ionic and electrical conductivity of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) make it an ideal material for the skin/tissue-electronic interface. However, pristine PEDOT:PSS-based devices cannot meet the requirements for practical use. Toward this end, herein, the development of PEDOT:PSS-based electrodes and their most recent advances in sensing bioelectrical signals are summarized. First, the generation mechanism of bioelectrical signals is introduced in detail. Then, according to the characteristics of bioelectrical signals, the requirements of bioelectrodes are discussed. Next, representative achievements for improving conductivity, stretchability, and stability of PEDOT:PSS are introduced. Bioelectrical signals such as electromyogram (EMG), electrocardiogram (ECG), electrooculogram (EOG), and electroencephalogram (EEG) are successfully recorded by these PEDOT:PSS-based electrodes. Finally, a brief summary is provided, and the opportunities and challenges are also discussed. \n",

      " In this work, we investigate organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) as a novel artificial electronic device for the realization of synaptic behavior, bioelectronics, and a variety of applications. A numerical method considering the Poisson-Boltzmann statistics is introduced to reproduce associated charge densities, electrostatics and switching properties of OECTs. We shed light on the working principle of OECTs by taking into account the ionic charge distribution in the electrolyte and incomplete ionization of the organic semiconductor describing the underlying electrochemical redox reaction. This enables analyzing the OECTs electrical performance as well as a simplified chemical properties via an electrical double layer, doping and de-doping of the OMIEC layer. We have fabricated, characterized, simulated and analyzed OECTs based on PEDOT:PSS, and we show that the proposed model reveals important properties of the device's working mechanism. The model shows a good agreement with the experimental data of the fabricated devices. \n",

      " Despite possible toxicity issues, chemical reduction or non-polarizable electrodes incorporated with highly reactive chemical species have been utilized to control the operational characteristics of organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) for bioelectronic interfacing applications. In this study, we demonstrate that crosslinking between highly conductive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) and biocompatible nonconductive polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) effectively modulates the mixed conducting properties of PEDOT:PSS. The PEDOT:PSS-PVA films prepared by simple PEDOT:PSS and PVA blending at various ratios, spin-coating, crosslinking, and sulfuric acid treatment were comprehensively studied using optical spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and electrical/electrochemical device characterizations. With PVA contents up to 20 wt.%, the resultant PEDOT:PSS-PVA-based OECTs showed a linear threshold voltage shift with a marginal loss of transconductance, suggesting an effective modulation of the peak transconductance gate voltage. Furthermore, the PVA content also affects the ion transport dynamics, which is related to the crystallite size and ionic functional group density in the PEDOT:PSS-PVA system. The detailed mechanism of delicately controlled mixed conduction in the PEDOT:PSS-PVA system is proposed from the perspective of structure-property relations. \n",

      " Mixed conducting polymer films are of great interest in applications where an interface between electronic and ionic charge transport is needed, e.g., in bioelectronics, electrochemical energy applications, and photovoltaic device interfaces. The role of water on charge transport is of high relevance not only for aqueous environments but also for devices that are manufactured at ambient conditions with varying relative humidities. In this contribution, we present our results on the influence of controlled humidity changes on the mixed conductivity and correlation to the concomitant water uptake in the films. Two sulfonate-bearing polythiophene systems are studied: a self-made conjugated polyelectrolyte, poly(6-(thiophen-3-yl)hexane-1-sulfonate)-sodium (PTS-Na), and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT/PSS) with different ratios of PEDOT and the polyelectrolyte PSS. Our data give clear evidence of the similarities between the aforementioned polythiophene systems and pure ionic membranes such as Nafion used in fuel cells. As such, a phase separation between the hydrophobic electronically conducting polythiophene phase and the hydrophilic water-swellable ion-conducting phase is proposed. Changing the humidity from dry conditions up to similar to 90% relative humidity results in extremely high water uptakes of more than 90 wt %, which corresponds to similar to 13 water molecules per sulfonate unit at maximum water uptake. Conversely, the electronic conductivity is less sensitive to increasing humidity, which is due to percolation pathways. The ionic conductivity strongly increases from 10(-10) S/cm at dry conditions to 10(-3) S/cm at around 30 wt % water content and then levels off at maximum conductivities of 10(-3)-10(-2) S/cm up to water contents of 90 wt %. \n",

      " The electrocopolymerization of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) with the branched thiophene building block 2,2':3',2 ''-terthiophene (3T) is presented as a versatile route to functional polymer films. Comparisons to blend systems of the respective homopolymers PEDOT and P3T by in situ spectroelectrochemistry and Raman spectroscopy prove the successful copolymer formation and the access to tailored redox properties and energy levels. The use of EDOT-N-3 as co-monomer furthermore allows modifications of the films by polymer analogous reactions. Here, we exemplarily describe the post-functionalization with ionic moieties by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (click-chemistry) which allows to tune the surface polarity of the copolymer films from water contact angles of 140 degrees down to 40 degrees. \n",

      " The potential of 2,2';3,2-terthiophene (3T) as branching units in 3D copolymers is presented with EDOT as an example comonomer. Branched EDOT/3T polythiophenes were prepared by electropolymerization, and their electrochemical and optical properties are discussed. Two different approaches were employed: (i) the direct electropolymerization of a novel branched thiophene monomer (3TE(3)) consisting of a 3T core that contains three outer EDOT end groups and (ii) the electrochemical copolymerization of a EDOT/3T mixture in different ratios from [1:1] to [1:10]. Cyclic voltammetric and vis spectrometric experiments show that the EDOT content within the polymer has a strong influence on the electronic properties of the material: with increasing EDOT content, the HOMO-LUMO gap is decreased. To prove copolymer formation of EDOT and 3T, chemically synthesized reference copolymers of EDOT and 3T were prepared by oxidative coupling using FeCI3, and their optical and electronic properties were compared to those of the electrodeposited films. In addition, the copolymer formation is indicated by the comparison of the electrochemical and spectroscopic results with those of the homopolymers P3T and PEDOT. \n",
